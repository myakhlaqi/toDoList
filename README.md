## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a simple web application based on MEAN stack to store toDo list items for multiple lists. It uses the MongoDB Atlas to store the todo list and list items.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The following software must be installed before starting the project:

```
1- git
2- nodejs
3- mongodb (local) or mongodb atlas (on the cloud)
```
Clone the project by this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/myakhlaqi/toDoList.git
```
### Installing dependency

This project required the following nodejs dependencies:


```
    "body-parser": "^1.20.1",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "ejs": "^3.1.8",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "moment": "^2.29.4",
    "mongoose": "^6.8.0",
    "request": "^2.88.2"
```
To install all dependencies run following command on the project root
```
npm install 
```
To configure the MongoDB connection string create a .env file and replace your connection string. The sample .env file content presented here:
```
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/?readPreference=primary&ssl=false&directConnection=true"
PORT=3000
```
PORT refers to the nodejs server port on the server side.


## üîß Running <a name = "tests"></a>

After configuring everything in previous step you are ready to run the application locally.

To run the application locally you type:

```
npm run start
or
node index.js
```
Open following link to see the web application:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
The online version of the application is up and running at this URL:
```
https://todolist-1m63.onrender.com/
```


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

By default a new list will be created for every new day with the name of current date with default values.
To create a new list just add the list name to the url. For example to create a toDoList for your Home activity this url:

```
http://localhost:3000/home
or
https://todolist-1m63.onrender.com/home

```
